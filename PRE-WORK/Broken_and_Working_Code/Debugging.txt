DEBUGGING by Marcia Zegarra

Fun & great exercise! 

Missing punctuation and quotations.
Spacing in wrong places (hard to identify) 
Elements missing in various occasions (wasn't expecting this)
Wrong ref links to make javaScript work correctly.
CSS was basically perfect and no complicated.
The broken code it was actually very messy, no comments at all,
it didn't have good order to be read easily.
The name of the colors were not in the right places. I had to change it... 
happily I realized it just before finishing the exercise.



Loved the grumpy web page though!

Thanks.
