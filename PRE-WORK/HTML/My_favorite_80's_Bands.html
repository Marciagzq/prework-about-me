    <h3><u>BIO</u></h3>
    
    <p><em>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic band formed in Wirral, Merseyside in 1978. Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of 
        co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw[3] (drums); 
        McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, "Electricity"
        , in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 
        anti-war song "Enola Gay". The band achieved broader recognition via 
        their album Architecture & Morality (1981) and its three singles, all of which were international hits.</em></p>
